			<p>Purpose of this site is to inform people that raising cattle isn't as expensive as one may believe or think, allowing those who are less informed to gain some basic knowledge of cattle benefits. This site is designed to provide some insight information through personal experience for working and raising cattle. I personally believe, there is no better food than raising your own and knowing exactly what you're putting in your body and feeding your family. The better conditions you have for your herd, the happier the cow resulting in better beef.</p>
